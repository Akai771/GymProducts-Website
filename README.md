# GymProducts-Website
This React.js project is a gym consumption products website where users can browse and purchase a variety of products, such as protein powders, supplements, and workout apparel. The website also features a BMI calculator that allows users to determine their body mass index and receive personalized diet recommendations.

The code for this project is UI-only, meaning that it does not include any back-end functionality. However, the project is well-designed and provides a solid foundation for a fully functional website.
